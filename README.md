# WWDC20-Gonggong

Requisites

MacOS 10.15.4
MacOS Playground 3.3
Introduction

This is the playground I submitted for the WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge. I give my playground the name "Gonggong". 

The Story of Game :
In Indonesia there is still a name for catching fish by using "Pukat Harimau" which is fishing by damaging or illegal. 
The perpetrators used fish bombs with explosives from fertilizers, sulfur matches, and gunpowder from the bullets / bombs left over from the second war. 
The fishing makes some marine animals poisoned, so that the sea shells from Indonesia specifically in the Riau Islands region named "Gonggong" become poisoned. 
So that users as healthy Gonggong must avoid Gonggong that has been poisoned, if exposed, the game ends.

Third party resource used:

Background music: Ponies and Balloons by The Green Orbs from the Youtube Audio Library.
Icon: in part the icons in this game come from Flaticon, and I try to modified.
